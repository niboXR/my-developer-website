These are the files for my first game project.

Here is a breakdown of what each folder contains:

| rootfolder | purpose |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| code | contains code used to render documents, webpages, and final game. This includes all iterations of markdown (.md, .qmd) |
| data | contains data used to render documents, webpages, and final game. |
| docs | unpublished website docs |
| documentation | contains external documentation. Most documentation will be pdf versions of website docs. |
| templates | Templates and cheat sheets |
