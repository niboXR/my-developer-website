    "text": "Character\nCharacters are all humanoids that exist in the world, playable and non-playable. The following stats apply to both.\n\nCharacter stats\n\nPhysical stats\nA character has three physical stats:\n\nVitality - determines how much damage a character can take. A character’s base vitality stat is 100 life points.\nStrength - determines how much damage a character can deal. A character’s base strength stat is 10 damage. This means that a fully effective blow will deal 10 points in damage to another character’s vitality or an item’s durability.\nSpeed - determines how quickly a character can move. A character’s base walking speed is INSERT WLK_SPD and base running speed is INSERT RUN_SPD.\n\nThese base values are adjusted slightly based on the character build 1. See Table 1 for a generalized overview of this system based on character BMI 2. Physical stats can be further modified via items and consumables.\n\n\nStanding\nA character’s standing indicates their threat and morality to others. The two standing stats are:\n\nLevel - an evolving measure of a character’s accomplishments. It is derived from enemy encounter outcomes. A character’s default and minimum level is 1. The maximum level is 100.\nKarma - an evolving measure of a character’s deeds. It is derived from your actions. The quests you take on, the enemies you kill, and even your environmental impact will dictate your place in this world. The default karma is NEUTRAL. Creating a world with karmic justice requires deep considerations for both the penalties and consequences. See Section 3.1 on Karmic Justice for more.\n\n\n\n\nCharacter creation\n\n\nCharacter controller"

While this measure is considered imperfect for real-world applications, it provides a single measure from which base stats can be derived.↩︎\nA procedural system combines parameters for switching between categorical values and random sampling for continuous values. Note that available parameters and probability curves will likely be impacted by other values.↩︎\nA parallel world is one whose environment produces any number of distinct resources and ingredients not available in Solara. An item is considered exotic if it is located in a world without access to the resources it is crafted.↩︎"
