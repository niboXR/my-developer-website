A character’s base vitality stat is 100 life points.\nStrength - determines how much damage a character can deal. A character’s base strength stat is 10 damage. This means that a fully effective blow will deal 10 points in damage to another character’s vitality or an item’s durability.\nSpeed - determines how quickly a character can move. A character’s base walking speed is INSERT WLK_SPD and base running speed is INSERT RUN_SPD.\n\nThese base values are adjusted slightly based on the character build 1. See Table 1 for a generalized overview of this system based on character BMI 2.\nTable 1.
