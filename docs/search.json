    "text": "Character\nCharacters are humanoids that exist in the world, both playable and non-playable. Players create their characters using a custom character creator.\n\nCharacter stats\nThese stats apply to all characters\n\nPhysical stats\nA character has three physical stats:\n\nVitality - determines how much damage a character can take. A character’s base vitality stat is 100 life points.\nStrength - determines how much damage a character can deal. A character’s base strength stat is 10 damage. This means that a fully effective blow will deal 10 points in damage to another character’s vitality or an item’s durability.\nSpeed - determines how quickly a character can move. A character’s base walking speed is INSERT WLK_SPD and base running speed is INSERT RUN_SPD.\n\nBase physical stat values are weighted based on the character build 1. Table 1 provides discrete examples of the impact character BMI 2 has on a character’s physical stats.\nPhysical stats can be further modified via items.\n\n\nStanding\nA character’s standing indicates their threat and morality to others. The two standing stats are:\n\nLevel - an evolving measure of a character’s accomplishments. It is derived from enemy encounter outcomes. A character’s default and minimum level is 1. The maximum level is 100.\nKarma - an evolving measure of a character’s deeds. It is derived from your actions. The quests you take on, the enemies you kill, and even your environmental impact will dictate your place in this world. Karma ranges from DARK to HERO with a default value of NEUTRAL. Characters can also have GOOD or BAD karma.\n\n\nKarmic Justice\nCreating a world with karmic justice requires deep consideration of the actions that deserve karmic penalties and the consequences of accumulating bad karma penalties.\n\nKarmic penalties\n\nCharacter killing and looting\nTaking on and completing dark quests\nResource overconsumption and waste\n\n\n\nKarmic consequences\n\nLoss of safe zone and housing\nIncreased drop rates\nBounties"
